Personality Detection Using Decision Tree

This project incorporates the machine learning algorithm of Decision Tree in classifying the personalities of the people.For this project we used a dataset pf 350 people.

In this project we allow user to take up a test which is to answer all the 50 question with values range 0 to 5(both limits included).

Python was used as the backend language for handling the data coming from front end and to perform calculation on the incoming data. 
Different frameworks were also used like Sklearn, Numpy, Flask (to link the html with python), Pandas and Scippy.
